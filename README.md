# ft_linear_regression
This project is from 42 school.  
This is the introduction to machine learning with the concept of [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) using the [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) algorithm.  

The objective of this is to create a program that will be able to predict the price of a car based on its age (in km).  
The program will be trained using a dataset.  

## Basis
To create this program we need to create a fonction that based on the dataset will have the best average of the price based on the car age.  

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>If we represent the dataset it's something like this :</p>
            <img src="doc/dataset.png" width=500>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>And we want to obtain something like this :</p>
            <img src="doc/dataset_draw.png" width=500>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

As you see this representation of our "solution" is a straight line, which mean that it is defined by a linear function.  
In other words a linear function equals $a*x+b$.  

Where **a is the slope of the function** and **b is the intercept**.
